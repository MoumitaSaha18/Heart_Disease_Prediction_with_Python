# Heart_Disease_Prediction_with_Python

Outcome:

Result of the first model:
Model is saying 75% Heart Disease patients are Male.

About the first model:
We got the Precision value from the model is 7.5 out of 10. That should be more closer to 10. The Accuracy of the model is 63.74%. If the rate would more than 85% and the precision value is greater than 8,then we can say this model is quite good.

Result of the second model:
Model is saying 81.67 % patients has Heart Disease.

About The second Model:
We got the Precision value from the model is 7.9 out of 10. That should be more closer to 10. The Accuracy of this model is 81.67%. If the accuracy rate would more than 85% and the precision value is greater than 8 then we can say this model is quite good.
